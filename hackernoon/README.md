# Hackernoon challenges.

These are broken into categories for reference.

## Arrays

### 1. How do you find the missing number in a given integer array of 1 to 100?

#### Solve for:

 * Only 1 missing number
 * More than 1 missing number - Sorted Array
 * Same as above but Unsorted Array  


### 2. How do you find the duplicate number on a given integer array?

 * How do you find duplicate numbers in an array if it contains multiple duplicates?

### 3. How are duplicates removed from an array without using any library?

 * also How are duplicates removed from a given array in Java?
 * also How do you remove duplicates from an array in place?

### 4. How do you find the largest and smallest number in an unsorted integer array?

### 5. How do you find all pairs of an integer array whose sum is equal to a given number?

 * For one solution all pair means all pairs, so for num 3 if '1' and '2' appear twice then (1,2) should be returned four times as each element is a different pair.
 * Solve it for reduced pairs
 * do not return reverse pairings e.g for num 3 if '1' and '2' only appear once, no (1,2) AND (2,1). Just one or the other.
 * the array can contain negatives

#### Solve for:

 * Find the duplicate numbers
 * Remove them from the array in place (aka don't generate another array)


### 6. How is an integer array sorted in place using the quicksort algorithm? 

### 7. How do you reverse an array in place in javascript (don't use .reverse)?

### 8.  How to find the smallest positive integer value that cannot be represented as sum of any subset of a given array?
