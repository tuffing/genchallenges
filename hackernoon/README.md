# Hackernoon challenges.

These are broken into categories for reference.

## Arrays

### 1. How do you find the missing number in a given integer array of 1 to 100?

#### Solve for:

 * Only 1 missing number
 * More than 1 missing number - Sorted Array
 * Same as above but Unsorted Array  


### 2. How do you find the duplicate number on a given integer array?

 * How do you find duplicate numbers in an array if it contains multiple duplicates?

### 3. How are duplicates removed from an array without using any library?

 * also How are duplicates removed from a given array in Java?
 * also How do you remove duplicates from an array in place?

### 4. How do you find the largest and smallest number in an unsorted integer array?

### 5. How do you find all pairs of an integer array whose sum is equal to a given number?

 * For one solution all pair means all pairs, so for num 3 if '1' and '2' appear twice then (1,2) should be returned four times as each element is a different pair.
 * Solve it for reduced pairs
 * do not return reverse pairings e.g for num 3 if '1' and '2' only appear once, no (1,2) AND (2,1). Just one or the other.
 * the array can contain negatives

#### Solve for:

 * Find the duplicate numbers
 * Remove them from the array in place (aka don't generate another array)


### 6. How is an integer array sorted in place using the quicksort algorithm? 

### 7. How do you reverse an array in place in javascript (don't use .reverse)?

### 8.  How to find the smallest positive integer value that cannot be represented as sum of any subset of a given array?

## Sorting


### 1. How do you implement an insertion sort algorithm?

### 2. How is a merge sort algorithm implemented?

### 3. How do you implement a bucket sort algorithm?

### 4. How do you implement a counting sort algorithm?

### 5. How is a radix sort algorithm implemented?


## Strings

### How do you print duplicate characters from a string?

### How do you check if two strings are anagrams of each other?

### How do you print the first non-repeated character from a string?

### How can a given string be reversed using recursion?

### How do you check if a string contains only digits?

### How do you count a number of vowels and consonants in a given string?

### How do you find all permutations of a string?

### How do you reverse words in a given sentence without using any library method?

### How do you check if two strings are a rotation of each other?

### How do you check if a given string is a palindrome?


## Binary search Trees

### How is a binary search tree implemented?

### How do you print all nodes of a given binary tree using inorder traversal with / without recursion?

### How do you perform preorder traversal in a given binary tree?

### How do you traverse a given binary tree in preorder without recursion?

### How do you perform an inorder traversal in a given binary tree?


### How do you implement a postorder traversal algorithm?

### How do you traverse a binary tree in postorder traversal without recursion?

### How do you count a number of leaf nodes in a given binary tree?
